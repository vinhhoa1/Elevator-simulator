# Elevator-simulator
Elevator simulation is project trying to simulate a real life elevator in a simple scenario. The elevator will stay at the first floor at first. There are forty nine persons trying to use the elevator to go to their destination. However, the elevator can only hold seven people at a time. Therefore the elevator will only open the door for exactly seven people. Then it closes the door and starts going up. The elevator will stop at each floor and open the door, allow the people inside to leave. Once the elevator stop at floor ten, it will go straight back to floor one and repeat the same process until the waiting line is empty. To implement this project, I used forty nine threads for each of the persons waiting in line at floor one and one thread for the elevator. In addition, I also used three semaphores to coordinate all the threads.
